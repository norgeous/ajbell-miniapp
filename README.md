## Considerations

- Aesthetic presentation of the data
- Clarity and simplicity of code
- Standardisation
- Use of relevant frameworks for JS, CSS
- Front-end performance

## Future / Ideas / Didn't have time to do

- Local visual difference testing report with RegVis
- Capture both mobile and desktop views of stories with Storycap
- CI which runs linter, vitest tests, storybook tests, visual difference tests, checks project will compile, deploys Storybook, etc
- Use NPM workspaces to separate custom node modules; ie Storybook module, etc
- Use GTM to see where people abandon the flow
- Custom Storybook plugin(s) for whatever requirements
- Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to mock fetch - this might not work actually, im not sure if we can render server components inside storybook
- web bff pattern. move all data adapters into one place
